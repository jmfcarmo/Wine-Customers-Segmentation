# Customer Segmentation for Wonderful Wines of the World üç∑

This project was developed in the context of the "Data Mining 1" course and focuses on clustering-based customer segmentation for the wine retailer **Wonderful Wines of the World (WWW)**. Using unsupervised learning techniques, the goal was to help WWW transition from mass marketing to personalized strategies by identifying distinct customer groups based on **value** and **buying behavior**.

## üß† Project Objectives

1. **Engagement & Value Segmentation**:  
   Segment customers based on engagement and value (recency, frequency, monetary, LTV, etc.) to identify loyal, high-value, and at-risk customers.

2. **Product Preference Segmentation**:  
   Identify customer segments based on wine type preferences (dry red, sweet white, dessert, etc.).

3. **Strategy Development**:  
   Combine both segmentations to create actionable marketing recommendations for each group.
